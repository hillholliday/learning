# HHCC Learning
Here at [Hill Holliday](http://hhcc.com), we love learning (and alliteration). That's why we have a few initiatives like "Lunch and Learn", "Thirsty Theories", and "Mind-Expanding Mornings". We may not be able to travel all of the world to catch the best talks on our industry, but that doesn't mean we can't consume them from the comfort of our scrum room. We listen to industry and thought leaders in our space, and bring that service home to our clients.

Below you can find a weekly updated compendium of what we're learning here at Hill Holliday.

## Learning Initatives
- Lunch and Learn (weekly demonstration of a new technology we're working on or building)
- Mind-Expanding Mornings (twice-a-week meeting that focuses on UX/XD)
- Thirsty Theories (boozy meeting every Thursday where we learn about new trends in our industry)
