## #9 10/21/16 - Usability and Security
> Given that October is national security month, and that the largest DDoS attack on the Eastern United States in history hit Dyn this morning, I figured it would be a good idea to take a look at how we design and build secure software.

> Adrienne Porter Felt from the Google Chrome team has a talk from Usenix 2015 where should demonstrate how designing usable security is difficult. With a set of case-studies, Adrienne will show how the world of security falters at the intersection of usability and security, and what we as experience builders can do about it. — Martin

## #5 09/16/16 - Designing for Accessibility 
> For this week we're gonna hang out with Elise Roy, a deaf artist and lawyer, for a talk titled "When we design for disability, we all benefit". I think this will be a great talk to get us thinking about how we design and develop experiences for all types of people, not just the norm. — Rob

## #4 08/25/16 - Hacking Technology
> For our 4th theories meetup, Alberto has picked out a TED talk that showcases how different technology working together in tandem can yield some crazy innovative results. This talk definitely shows off some cool tech research, but I'm hoping it will lead to a larger discussion around how we can bend technology to do what we want in a creative setting.

## #2 08/11/16 - VR Showcase

## #1 08/04/16 - Inventing on Principle
### Bret Victor 
> For our first session, I'd like to share with you guys a talk that I had watched when I was starting my career that changed the way I look at design and development. It features Bret Victor, an engineer and UI developer who lead the Future Interface Prototyping team at Apple from 2007-2012, where he shares his philosophy of inventing and concepting on principal.
